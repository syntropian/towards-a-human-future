Introduction
- Humanity, seeing the world from the outside for the first time (overview effect and planetary consciousness -> self-recongition of biosphere)
    - Narrative nonfiction of astronauts experiencing overview effect?
- Humanity, seeing the world at existential risk for the first time (nukes and then climate) while none in power take decisive action
- Seeing yourself as a powerless atomic individual in a time of global crisis: what can possibly be done?
- Brief mention of antecedents of these ideas, relevant historical and present-day thinkers and movements, who gets referenced in the book
- What I'm going to talk about for the rest of the book

The cosmogenesis, the true creation story of the universe and of our evolution, is the story of major evolutionary transitions in individuality
- what is a major evolutionary transition in individuality
- retell history of cosmos, geosphere, biosphere, humanity through that lens ("supertree of life")
- what lessons can we learn about how evolution has historically progressed through these transitions (transitions emerge through integration and differentiation of individuals into larger wholes, along with changes in the way that information is transmitted that facilitate that integration and differentiation; transitions often contemperaneous with global systemic crisis, either causing it, being caused by it, or both; proper conditions for transition emerge slowly, but transition happens rapidly; most transitional forms fail, but you only need to get lucky once)

The biosphere is in the middle of a major evolutionary transition in individuality right now
- the great acceleration, etc -> global ecological crisis
- scenario analysis/near-future predictions: what can we gain if we succeed? what are the consequences if we fail?

Transitional forms in human eusociality emerge as forms of religion or forms of left-wing politics, especially revolutionary left-wing politics
- human social evolution over time - legacy of domination vs legacy of freedom
- what it means to make social progress - expansion of circle of self-identification
- history of left-wing social movements - their failures and successes

First requirement is a new ethics -> a change of heart (metanoia) -> change in perceived purpose & end goals for individuals and for society that can facilitate pro-social individual and collective behavior
- A new metanarrative (the cosmogenesis) yields a new foundational ethics
- Establishing the value of the individual
- Establishing the value of the whole biosphere
- Establishing the value of the whole cosmos
- Establishing the value of the future

Second requirement is a new ideology to unify as much of humanity as possible around the project of individual and collective survival and flourishing in the cosmos, an ideal to struggle towards together and a framework for highly functional but non-dominating social organization
- Synthesizing Marxism and anarchism for a liberatory politics of the future
- Synthesizing liberatory politics and ecotheology (in secular, New Age, or traditional religious forms) for a terrapolitan civic religion

Third requirement is a practical model for achieving meaningful progress towards a transition in time to avert the worst outcomes
- We've talked about theory, now let's talk about praxis
- Three possible orientations towards system change (Erik Olin Wright)
- Varieties of revolutionary organisation
- Possible recipes for success for each of them
- Higher-level integration of revolutionary organizations
