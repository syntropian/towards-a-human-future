# Towards a Human Future
surviving the 21st century and achieving the next major evolutionary transition in individuality

## Introduction
"Once a photograph of the Earth, taken from the outside, is available... a new idea as powerful as any in history will be let loose." -- Fred Hoyle

Earthrise photo (Apollo 8)

13.8 billion years after the emergence of the universe, a small piece of it has complexified to the point where a mote of that piece can fly off into the space beyond and look back at itself, glimpsing its own image for the first time, and feeling the shock of recognition of looking into a mirror

Overview effect

The beginnings of a true planetary self-consciousness

Another iconic image with which you may be familiar is the Keeling curve

At the same time we are stretching our capacities beyond the limits of our own gravity well, we are stumbling towards the destruction of both ourselves and all known complex life in the universe along with us

How to explain this contradiction - and, more importantly, how to resolve it?

As far as we know, we are alone in the universe. Nobody is coming to save us. We alone are responsible for our future and the future of our planet.

Our capabilities for creation and destruction have far outpaced the primate hardware on which we're running

We have grown past our old stories and don't yet have a new story that can help us integrate everything we've learned

Bronze age metanarratives, medieval morality, and premodern politics with modern technology is a recipe for destruction

We need a new story, a new morality, and a new politics to survive what's coming

Goals of this text: elaborate simultaneous syntheses of science and religion (Terrapolitan Earth Religion), anarchism and communism (Social Ecology), and organic society and technological civilization (Earth Nationalism), explain why such a triple synthesis is needed and how it could help us resolve the present crisis, lay out a program for its implementation in terms of specific tactics, strategies, and institutional forms (Earthrise Movement), articulate a vision of a possible future society that makes these ideals a reality (Libertarian Ecosocialism), and explain how these foundations point towards the specific goals we should try to achieve to maximize our potential as a species and the fecundity of the cosmos generally (Gaian Cosmism)

Highlight how the text will incorporate eco-theological elements of all major religions and a sampling of indigenous traditions, and will freely wobble back and forth between scientific and religious terminology without loss of meaning

Apologize for anything I left out

Thank people that helped

Set stage for rest of book

## Part I: The Great Story
What is the situation in which we find ourselves, and how did we get here?

### Cosmogenesis
The first evidence-based, crowdsourced creation story in human history

The becomings of Gaia, the planetary superorganism

Introduce the major evolutionary transitions: the creation of a new level of organization that transcends and includes all lower levels through differentiation and integration

Introduce the concept of the biosphere, Gaia theory, etc.

Introduce the concept of a transition crisis (disruption in biospheric self-regulation due to a major evolutionary transition that may trigger a mass extinction event e.g. the great oxygenation event and Snowball Earth)

Homo sapiens is stalled halfway through a major evolutionary transition

Complete the transition and break through to a future of unlimited possibilities, or undergo mass extinction that may include us

### Alas, Babylon
The Great Acceleration and the crisis of neoliberal industrial civilization

Historical collapses of complex civilizations

Ecological overshoot and climate change

The necessity of decisive action

### A Banquet of Consequences
Future dystopias under conditions of ecological collapse: ecofascism, bourgeois exterminism, amoral unbound AI, hothouse Earth

### The Cosmological Endowment
What is out there in the cosmos for us to find, and why it matters

Introduce the Fermi Paradox and the Firstborn Hypothesis

Possibilities for stabilization of the biosphere, settlement of the solar system, expansion to rest of the galaxy and beyond

### Why We Fight
Long-term potentialities for life in the cosmos

Future utopias under conditions of syntropic cooperation (the Realm of Freedom): post-scarcity, morphological freedom, universal flourishing

Entropy and the end of time

Historical bifurcation points and the outsize influence of currently living humans on the trajectory of life in the universe

History is ours, and the people make history

Not hope, but courage

What will future historians - that is, if there end up being any - write about the people living now on the Earth? What deeds will be commmemorated, criticized, or abhorred as evil? Who will be held up as exemplars, prophets, saviors - and who as villains?

## Part II: Syntropic Axiology
What has intrinsic (not subjective) value? Upon what foundation should our ethics, and therefore our politics, be constructed?

### Who Matters?
Anarchist ethics: the instrinsic value of an individual sentient being, indivisible from the intrinsic value of the communities of which they are a member

### World as Lover, World as Self
Gaian ethics: the intrinsic value of the biosphere as a collective whole, along with all of the individual living components of which it consists
[Callicott, 2013](<#callicott2013>)

### Never Alone Again
Panbiotic ethics: the intrinsic value of life in the universe

### Stewards of Creation
Cosmic ethics: the intrinsic value of the universe itself

The potential of non-living matter-energy to become life (which we have already established has value)

The teleological character of matter-energy

### Beyond the Horizon
The intrinsic value of the future over the present

Utilitarian and deontological calculus for value of future life

Csikszentmihalyi - increasing complexity expressed as increasing integration, differentiation - as an inherent good
