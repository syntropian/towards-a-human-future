# Towards a Human Future
surviving the 21st century and achieving the next major evolutionary transition in individuality

## Part I: The Great Story
What is the situation in which we find ourselves, and how did we get here?

### Cosmogenesis
The first evidence-based, crowdsourced creation story in human history

The becomings of Gaia, the planetary superorganism

Introduce the major evolutionary transitions: the creation of a new level of organization that transcends and includes all lower levels through differentiation and integration

Introduce the concept of the biosphere, Gaia theory, etc.

Introduce the concept of a transition crisis (disruption in biospheric self-regulation due to a major evolutionary transition that may trigger a mass extinction event e.g. the great oxygenation event and Snowball Earth)

Homo sapiens is stalled halfway through a major evolutionary transition

Complete the transition and break through to a future of unlimited possibilities, or undergo mass extinction that may include us

### Alas, Babylon
The Great Acceleration and the crisis of neoliberal industrial civilization

Historical collapses of complex civilizations

Ecological overshoot and climate change

The necessity of decisive action

### A Banquet of Consequences
Future dystopias under conditions of ecological collapse: ecofascism, bourgeois exterminism, amoral unbound AI, hothouse Earth

### The Cosmological Endowment
What is out there in the cosmos for us to find, and why it matters

Introduce the Fermi Paradox and the Firstborn Hypothesis

Possibilities for stabilization of the biosphere, settlement of the solar system, expansion to rest of the galaxy and beyond

### Why We Fight
Long-term potentialities for life in the cosmos

Future utopias under conditions of syntropic cooperation (the Realm of Freedom): post-scarcity, morphological freedom, universal flourishing

Entropy and the end of time

The teleological character of living systems

Historical bifurcation points and the outsize influence of currently living humans on the trajectory of life in the universe

History is ours, and the people make history

Not hope, but courage

What will future historians - that is, if there end up being any - write about the people living now on the Earth? What deeds will be commmemorated, criticized, or abhorred as evil? Who will be held up as exemplars, prophets, saviors - and who as villains?

Set stage for rest of book

## Part II: Syntropic Axiology
What has intrinsic (not subjective) value? Upon what foundation should our ethics, and therefore our politics, be constructed?

### Who Matters?
Anarchist ethics: the instrinsic value of an individual sentient being, indivisible from the intrinsic value of the communities of which they are a member

### World as Lover, World as Self
Gaian ethics: the intrinsic value of the biosphere as a collective whole, along with all of the individual living components of which it consists

### Never Alone Again
Panbiotic ethics: the intrinsic value of life in the universe

### Beyond the Horizon
The intrinsic value of the future over the present

Utilitarian and deontological calculus for value of future life

Csikszentmihalyi - increasing complexity expressed as increasing integration, differentiation - as an inherent good
